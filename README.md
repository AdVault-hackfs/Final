# Advault Dashboard

Advault Dashboard is a web application where customer companies can upload information about their ads in text, images, and video formats. This information is then stored in [Lighthouse storage](https://docs.lighthouse.storage/lighthouse-1) (built on Filecoin), and an API written in Express.js retrieves the data for partner companies to display in their blockchain-based products.

## Features

- Upload text, images, and videos for ads
- Store ad data securely in Filecoin
- Retrieve and display ad data via API
- Easy integration with partner companies' platforms using SDK
